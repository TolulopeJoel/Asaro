- I hate the fact that the "Add Entry" page shows loading, fix that!
- Make entries count on main page real-time
- Make deleting of a past entry real-time
- Ability to edit past entries (the logic is in place, just push on next update)
- Add navbar (past entries, profile), then round button to add entry on home page
- Feature for users to add verses, not just chapters
- Streak days view (colored jooor)
